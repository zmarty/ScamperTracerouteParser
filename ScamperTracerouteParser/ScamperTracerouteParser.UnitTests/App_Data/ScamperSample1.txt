# =======================================================================
# This file contains an ASCII representation of the IP paths stored in
# the binary skitter arts++ and scamper warts file formats.
#
# This ASCII file format is in the sk_analysis_dump text output
# format: imdc.datcat.org/format/1-003W-7
#
# =======================================================================
# There is one trace per line, with the following tab-separated fields:
#
#
#  1. Key -- Indicates the type of line and determines the meaning of the
#            remaining fields.  This will always be 'T' for an IP trace.
#
# -------------------- Header Fields ------------------
#
#  2. Source -- Source IP of skitter/scamper monitor performing the trace.
#
#  3. Destination -- Destination IP being traced.
#
#  4. ListId -- ID of the list containing this destination address.
#
#        This value will be zero if no list ID was provided.  (uint32_t)
#
#  5. CycleId -- ID of current probing cycle (a cycle is a single run
#                through a given list).  For skitter traces, cycle IDs
#                will be equal to or slightly earlier than the timestamp
#                of the first trace in each cycle. There is no standard
#                interpretation for scamper cycle IDs.
#
#        This value will be zero if no cycle ID was provided.  (uint32_t)
#
#  6. Timestamp -- Timestamp when trace began to this destination.
#
# -------------------- Reply Fields ------------------
#
#  7. DestReplied -- Whether a response from the destination was received.
#
#        R - Replied, reply was received
#        N - Not-replied, no reply was received;
#            Since skitter sends a packet with a TTL of 255 when it halts
#            probing, it is still possible for the final destination to
#            send a reply and for the HaltReasonData (see below) to not
#            equal no_halt.  Note: scamper does not perform last-ditch
#            probing at TTL 255 by default.
#
#  8. DestRTT -- RTT (ms) of first response packet from destination.
#        0 if DestReplied is N.
#
#  9. RequestTTL -- TTL set in request packet which elicited a response
#      (echo reply) from the destination.
#        0 if DestReplied is N.
#
# 10. ReplyTTL -- TTL found in reply packet from destination;
#        0 if DestReplied is N.
#
# -------------------- Halt Fields ------------------
#
# 11. HaltReason -- The reason, if any, why incremental probing stopped.
#
# 12. HaltReasonData -- Extra data about why probing halted.
#
#        HaltReason            HaltReasonData
#        ------------------------------------
#        S (success/no_halt)    0
#        U (icmp_unreachable)   icmp_code
#        L (loop_detected)      loop_length
#        G (gap_detected)       gap_limit
#
# -------------------- Path Fields ------------------
#
# 13. PathComplete -- Whether all hops to destination were found.
#
#        C - Complete, all hops found
#        I - Incomplete, at least one hop is missing (i.e., did not
#            respond)
#
# 14. PerHopData -- Response data for the first hop.
#
#       If multiple IP addresses respond at the same hop, response data
#       for each IP address are separated by semicolons:
#
#       IP,RTT,nTries                   (for only one responding IP)
#       IP,RTT,nTries;IP,RTT,nTries;... (for multiple responding IPs)
#
#         where
#
#       IP -- IP address which sent a TTL expired packet
#       RTT -- RTT of the TTL expired packet
#       nTries -- number of tries before response received from hop
#
#       This field will have the value 'q' if there was no response at
#       this hop.
#
# 15. PerHopData -- Response data for the second hop in the same format
#       as field 14.
